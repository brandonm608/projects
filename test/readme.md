#Sorting Algorithms

This project contains different in-place array sorting algorithms

##Goal

Exploring the performance of various sorting algorithms. Times may vary depending on time spent outside of the main application code. Beyond timing the algorithms I hope to find a sorting algorithm that comes close to the openJDK11 built-in sorting algorithm. My best performing algorithm is HybridSort2.
